# Power-BI-Dashboard

**Themes**: SQL, PowerBI, DAX and Data Analysis

### Project Summary



### Results

The following is a PowerBI dashboard of visulizations that utlized what I found to be the most important features that help understand student course outcomes


### Structure and Procedures

 1. Prepprocess and subset data 
 
    * CSV file data is loaded in to SQL Developer where preprocessing is easier. A subset of the data containing only... is selected so that computations times are reduced  
    
 2. Understanding factors that affect course outcome. 
     
     * I look into the research done around predicting student course outcome and examine the most effective variables that reserachers had used, in hopes that more interesting visuzliations can be created. 
     
 3. Dashboard creation 
 
     * PowerBI
