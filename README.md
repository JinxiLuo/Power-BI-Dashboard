# Power-BI-Dashboard

**Themes**: SQL, PowerBI, DAX and Data Analysis

### Project Summary

This project is an extension of an assignment with the same Open University Learning Analytics data set. Which explored the role of educational data mining and learning analytics to understand student learning, course outcomes and preparation of a set of features for predicting course outcome. In this project, SQL is used to subset required data with visualizations produced in PowerBI instead of Python.  

### Results

The following is a PowerBI dashboard of visulizations that utlized what I found to be the most important features that help understand student course outcomes - [To be added]


### Structure and Procedures

 1. Prepprocess and subset data 
 
    * CSV file data is loaded in to SQL Developer where preprocessing is easier. A subset of the data is selected so that computations times are reduced  
    
 2. Understanding factors that affect course outcome. 
     
     * I look into the research done around predicting student course outcome and examine the most effective variables that reserachers had used, in hopes that more interesting visuzliations can be created. 
     
 3. Dashboard creation 
 
     * Using PowerBI, a dashboard is created that uses good visulization principles and explores the application of DAX.
